        <h3>Role: designer</h3>
        <h3>Target site: <span><a href="https://events.umich.edu/">Michigan Events</a></span></h3>
        <hr/>
        <p><strong>Suggestion1</strong>: The site uses only color (yellow) for its emphamsis on suggested search keywords. It can add more indicators such as underline or italic to let people who cannot distinguish color easily still have the ability to get the emphasis.</p>      
       
        <p><strong>Suggestion2</strong>: The main color identity <span style="color: #00afaf">Tiffany Blue </span> has bad contrast with the <span style="color: dimgrey"> dark grey </span>background. I suggest the site to use another font color for a better color contrast or choose not to use grey to as its background color.</p>  
            
        <p><strong>Suggestion3</strong>: Most of the links on the site don't have a focus state for users who use keyboard to know where they are on the sites. It can add hover or focus state to its navigation, footer and the "card" like elements to indicate there are links on it and they're clickable.</p>    
        </div>
        
        <p><strong>Suggestion4</strong>: There are a lot of errors regarding the <a> tag and alt attribute. They include "alt" attribute in the <a> tag, which is not allowed. Also, it should use aria-label for icons and imgs to avoid empty text in the link.
